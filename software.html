        <h2>Storing Program Concept and Computer Architectures</h2>
        <p>The history of computing changed with the notion of storing programs in the memory so that the computers can utilized in sequence to execute instructions and store it for the future use. This innovation, credited to Von Neumann Architecture, enables a computer to run program and data in the same memory which of course makes the system more flexible and easier to program.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Neumann Architecture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The Von Neumann architecture uses a single memory space to store both data and instructions.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Features:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Shared Memory: Both data and instructions are stored in the same RAM.
                    </li>
                    <li>Single Data Bus: Data and instructions share the same communication path.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sequential Processing: The system processes one instruction at a time (fetch-decode-execute cycle).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Harvard Architecture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The Harvard architecture separates memory for data and instructions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Features:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Separate Memories: Different storage for instructions and data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Dual Data Buses: Instructions and data have separate communication paths.
                    </li>
                    <li>Parallel Processing: Enables simultaneous fetching of instructions and data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
        <p>The concept of storing program which is seen in the Von Neumann Architecture pattern has a lot of benefits. Since the data and instructions are stored in the same location, hardware implementation is made easier and since the instructions can be easily reprogrammed it is easier to employ the computer for other tasks. This design is affordable and also becomes the foundation for most current computing structures.</p>

            However, it has also major drawbacks like the Von Neumann bottleneck. It is so because data and instructions use the same bus for passing information and thus they cannot access the bus at the same instance thus slowing down the speed of the system. Furthermore, it makes it easier for errors such as instructions being written over by data already residing in the shared memory.</li>

    <!-- Purpose of BIOS -->
    <section class="ROCUS">
        <h2>Purpose of BIOS</h2>
        <p>The BIOS is the firmware located in the motherboard of a computer. It is also used during 
            booting to initialize the hardware and also offer run time support to the operating system. When the computer is switched on, 
            BIOS runs a set check referred to as the Power-On Self-Test checking the RAM, CPU and other components.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Another important feature of the BIOS is boot up initialization which refers to booting up and launching a storage operating system into the computer’s memory. 
            Furthermore, it brings into functionality the devices like keyboards, monitors, and storage devices among others. Through BIOS setup
             utility users are able to control different system setting including boot order. The primary functions of BIOS are to serve as the connection between the hardware and the operating system, the computer booting and to manage an efficient running of the computer.
