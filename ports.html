        <h2>The Need for Input Devices</h2>
        <p>Various types of input devices are one of the components of a computer system where users feed in data and 
            commands into a system. If there were no input devices, the users would be unable to provide 
            the data the computer needs to perform the instructed actions.
        </p> 
        <br>

        <h2>The Need for Output Devices</h2>
        <p>
            Output devices enable a user to perceive or read the results of the process
             that has been done by the computer system. Such devices enable information 
             processed by a computer to be presented in forms that are visible, audible, or in any other way.
        </p>

        <h2>The Need for Peripheral Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            Peripheral hardware comprises all hardware devices that are used externally to 
            enhance the capability of a computer. Such devices can be considered as input/output and storage 
            peripherals, and they are essential for adjusting the computer 
            systems to meet the demands of certain users.
        </p>

        <h3>Examples of Peripheral Hardware</h3>
        <ul class="two-column">
            <li><strong>External Hard Drives: </strong> 
                Provide additional space for storing large amounts of data or backing up important files.

                <li>
                    USB type-C connections are common today and take over older standards such as Micro-B 
                    because they are effective and can transfer power. LAN inputs are still needed to achieve 
                    high-speed and better performance connections. On the other end of the spectrum, ports such as 
                    parallel and COM are considered to be outdated in modern personal computing due to their relatively 
                    lower speeds, and dynamic and unattractive physical structure. The various port types are however used 
                    based on the hardware and the application as mentioned below.

                        <li> <strong>Purpose: </strong> 
                            USB is a multi-functional interface aimed at providing 
                            interaction between computers and an extended list of peripherals 
                            and devices such as keyboards, mice, printers, drives, and phones. 
                            Alternatively, it is capable of supporting both data and power routes.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Function: </strong>
                            USB ports are an improved way of connecting a device to a computer as they 
                            replace other older and slower ports. Current day types such as USB 3.0 or USB 
                            type C are compatible with previous device technologies.

                        Parallel ports were commonly used in transfer of data to peripheral devices such as printers. 
                        They enable parallel transmission of several bits of data.
