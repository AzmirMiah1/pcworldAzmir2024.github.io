        <h2>Internal System Unit Components</h2>
        <p>The system unit contains essential components for the computer’s functionality. Key components include:</p>
        <br>
        <p> Elements of a typical or general computer include the Central Processing Unit, the Main Memory and various Input/Output devices. The CPU is responsible to perform all operations of a computer like calculating, receiving instructions and other operations. It interacts with the main memory (RAM) for reading and writing operations to be performed at fast rates. They are used to keep data temporarily so as to enhance the processing of information from the CPU. The data from input devices such as the keyboards and mouse are input to the CPU while the result from output devices such as the monitor and printers is output from the CPU. Several elements make up a system bus: address, data and control which allow for the interconnection of these components. The system bus makes it possible for data, command, as well as memory addresses, to move freely within the computer with the right interaction between the parts.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> Often considered the "brain" of the computer, it processes instructions from software and manages tasks through various processing units.</li>
            <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that connects all hardware components, including the CPU, RAM, and storage devices, enabling communication between them.</li>
            <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Temporary storage that holds data for active tasks, allowing quick access and efficient multitasking.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU):</strong> Converts electricity from an outlet into usable power for the computer and distributes it to components.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Drives (HDD/SSD):</strong> Permanent storage for data and applications. SSDs are faster than HDDs due to their lack of moving parts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fetch-Execute Cycle</h2>
        <p>The fetch-execute cycle is the process through which the CPU retrieves instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them. This cycle consists of four steps:</p>
        <br>
        <p>The two main functions of a CPU are discussed below; in relation to Roles and responsibilities: Fetch-Execute Cycle The following duties relate to the fetch-execute cycle; In the fetch phase, the CPU takes an instruction normally from the memory. Decode in which the control unit decodes the instruction and execute in which the specified process is performed, sometimes it involves calculation or logical operation by means of ALU. The Control Unit (CU) oversees responsibility of these tasks and controls the information flow. It uses pulses to help to synchronize all operations that relate to the CPU. These are small storage areas in the CPU where data and instructions are stored during processing; this makes processing faster since frequent access to main memory is not needed.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> The CPU fetches the instruction from memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Decode:</strong> The control unit interprets the instruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Execute:</strong> The ALU or another component carries out the instruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Store:</strong> The result is stored for later use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Roles of the ALU, Control Unit, Clock, and Registers</h2>
        <p><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Performs arithmetic and logical operations required by programs.</p>
        <p><strong>Control Unit:</strong> Directs operations within the CPU, managing data flow between components.</p>
        <p><strong>Clock:</strong> Synchronizes the timing of all processes in the CPU, measured in cycles per second.</p>
        <p><strong>Registers:</strong> Small storage locations within the CPU that hold data for quick access during processing.</p>

        <h2>Cache and Virtual Memory</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Cache, Virtual memory Cache memory is a special high speed storage location within the CPU , which stores the most frequently used data and instructions in the computer. This decreases the usage of the main memory to obtain data for the CPU, thus improving its computational efficiency. Virtual memory comes into play when the physical memory in your machine is not sufficient. It opens an area on the hard disk and provides additional space for the main memory thus making the system capable of undertaking bigger jobs or several programs. By using virtual memory there is also capability to undertake more multitasking, however it is significantly slower than the RAM due to time it takes to access the hard disk. Both cache and virtual memory means that a computer will be in a position to run even under high demand.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Cache Memory:</strong> A small amount of fast memory within the CPU to temporarily store data for quick access. It speeds up the processing by avoiding repeated access to slower main memory.</p>
        <p><strong>Virtual Memory:</strong> A portion of storage that functions as extra RAM. When the RAM is full, the computer stores data in virtual memory, slowing down the system but enabling multitasking beyond the physical limits of RAM.</p>

        <h2>Backing Storage Types and Performance Factors</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Long-term data storage is supported by backing storage. They include hard disk drive (HDDs), solid state drives (SSDs), pen drives, optical media (CD’s, DVD’s), flash memory cards. The performance criteria include the rate at which data can be transferred either to be read or to be written and the total amount of data that can be transferred at a time. The advantages of SSDs are higher transfer rates and enhanced performance as compared with HDDs, but it is followed by higher cost. Optical media are: cheap, access is possible only by their removal from the computer but their access is slow. The flash memory cards and pen drives are mobile and available in different capacities for temporary document transfer and storage.        </p>
